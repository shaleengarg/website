What have I learnt in my 22 years on Planet Earth.

Many a times, I have come across interviews with confounding questions like, "What would you tell the 5 year old self?", or "What is one thing you would change if gotten a chance to go back in time?"; the first question not only makes me feel old, but also asks me to go back 17 years to the then state of my mind. 
I am rather willing to do it today, than wait for some interviewer to inquire about it in future; going back in time makes me feel sad about growing up in the first place.

Before this passage becomes an innundation of my feelings, let me begin:

*What scares me the most?
-> Uncertainity
Man, unlike other living things, has historically tried to make life certain for him/her self. Some things include farming, permanent shelter, hunting tools, marriage, law & law enforcement, light(fire and electric), banks, government, supermarkets, telephones etc. Notice, these things ar

*What is the need for religion?
-> 


*What is the significance of the WORLD around me in my life?
->

*What is my significance in this world ?
->

*How do you define Right or Wrong?
->


* Who Am I?
-> This question has bewildered anyone and everyone who has attempted to solve it. Scientists try to find literature from science; Philosophers try and use erudite verbiage to further baffle listeners; Yogis try to draw parallels from different concepts all around their disciples and others shrug it off as GOD's will.
But there has to be some way, one could find meaning in the self; something which means more than literature or natural concepts or language; something which satisfies the hunger within. Maybe people who did not believe in documentation knew the answer, but it would be a waste of energy to try and go down that path.
If one cannot know "Who Am I ?", why not make the self something one fancies?
--My choices make me me

*What should be my aim in life?
-> 7 pillars of life
    unbriddled laugh


*How Do I do What I want to do?
-> drops on the stone
